Hey guys, thanks for stopping by my git repo!

A little about myself: I'm a german Fullstack developer who has worked on a few of projects, and looking to work on many more!

You can find me on Linkedin [here](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-novak) :slightly_smiling_face:

Thanks for stopping by and have a pleasant day!
